Engineering Risk and Reliability
=================================

Subsea systems operate in harsh and inaccessible environments, making failure extremely costly and hazardous. This section introduces key methodologies for assessing and mitigating engineering risk, as well as designing for reliability throughout the system lifecycle.

Overview of Risk Management
----------------------------

Engineering risk refers to the **probability and consequence** of failure in technical systems. Risk management involves:

- **Hazard identification**
- **Risk assessment and quantification**
- **Mitigation planning**
- **Monitoring and continuous improvement**

Key industry standards include:

- ISO 31000 (Risk management)
- API RP 17N (Subsea reliability and risk management)
- DNV-RP-A203 (Technology qualification)



Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
------------------------------------------

**FMEA** is a systematic approach to identifying potential failure modes, their causes, and their effects.

Each component is analyzed in terms of:

- **Failure Mode**
- **Effect on system**
- **Cause of failure**
- **Detection method**
- **Severity (S)**, **Occurrence (O)**, **Detection (D)** scores

The **Risk Priority Number (RPN)** is calculated as:

.. math::

   RPN = S \times O \times D

High RPN components are prioritized for redesign, monitoring, or redundancy.

Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA)
-----------------------------------

QRA involves **probabilistic modeling** of risks using:

- Event trees and fault trees
- Failure rate databases (e.g., OREDA)
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Bayesian networks

Common outputs:

- Individual risk levels (IR)
- Frequency-severity plots
- ALARP justification (As Low As Reasonably Practicable)

Reliability Engineering in Subsea Systems
------------------------------------------

Subsea reliability engineering focuses on ensuring mission success under uncertain conditions. Techniques include:

- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**
- **Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD)**
- **Redundancy allocation**
- **Load-sharing analysis**

For example, in a subsea control system:

- Redundant hydraulic lines improve availability
- Hot-swappable SCMs reduce Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
- Sensors are duplicated in critical flowlines


Technology Qualification (TQ)
------------------------------

New or unproven technologies must undergo qualification to demonstrate fitness for service.

**DNV-RP-A203** defines a 5-step approach:

1. Technology assessment
2. Threat identification
3. Failure mode screening
4. Qualification testing
5. Risk-based validation

TQ is essential when deploying new materials, control systems, or installation methods in subsea projects.

Barrier Management and Safety
------------------------------

Safety-critical functions must be protected by **multiple independent barriers**, in line with the **bow-tie model**:

- Prevention barriers (e.g., pressure relief valves)
- Detection barriers (e.g., leak detection sensors)
- Mitigation barriers (e.g., ESD valves, isolation modules)

Barrier performance must be monitored through:

- Integrity assurance KPIs
- Functional testing
- Safety Integrity Level (SIL) assessment (per IEC 61508 / IEC 61511)

.. note::

   Risk and reliability are not add-onsâ€”they are embedded in every stage of subsea system design, from concept to decommissioning.
