Flow Assurance
==============

Flow assurance ensures the uninterrupted, safe, and economical transport of multiphase fluids from the reservoir to processing facilities. It addresses a range of thermal, chemical, and mechanical phenomena that may disrupt flow in subsea pipelines.

Core Objectives
----------------

- Maintain continuous flow of hydrocarbons
- Prevent plugging due to solids (hydrates, wax, scale, asphaltenes)
- Control pressure and temperature drop
- Manage slug flow and flow transients
- Ensure start-up, shutdown, and pigging reliability

Multiphase Flow Characteristics
-------------------------------

Produced fluids often exist in **multiphase flow**: oil, gas, water, and solids. Common flow patterns include:

- Stratified
- Slug
- Annular
- Bubble flow

The pattern depends on:

- Flow velocity and density
- Pipe inclination
- Fluid properties and pressure


Thermal Behavior and Heat Transfer
----------------------------------

Temperature drops along subsea flowlines can lead to:

- Hydrate formation (gas + water at high pressure and low temperature)
- Wax deposition (from paraffinic hydrocarbons)
- Increased viscosity and flow resistance

Thermal modeling includes:

- Steady-state and transient simulations
- Heat loss to seawater and seabed
- Insulation and active heating systems (e.g., DEH, PIP)

Hydrate Formation and Mitigation
---------------------------------

Hydrates are crystalline compounds of gas and water that can plug flowlines rapidly. Key control methods:

- **Thermodynamic inhibition** (methanol, MEG injection)
- **Kinetic inhibitors and anti-agglomerants**
- **Thermal insulation** (to keep line temperature above hydrate point)
- **Depressurization and pigging**

Hydrate curve analysis is based on:

- Gas composition
- Pressure and temperature profiles
- Phase envelope via PVT analysis

Wax, Asphaltenes, and Scale
----------------------------

Other common solids that impact flow assurance include:

- **Wax**: precipitates at Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT)
- **Asphaltenes**: flocculate due to pressure drop or mixing
- **Scale**: mineral deposits (e.g., CaCO₃, BaSO₄) from water incompatibility

Mitigation measures:

- Chemical inhibitors
- Periodic pigging
- Heating systems
- Fluid blending and pressure control

Pressure Drop and Slugging
---------------------------

Flow assurance models pressure drop from:

- Frictional losses
- Elevation change
- Acceleration and phase interaction

Slugging problems (terrain-induced, hydrodynamic):

- Cause large pressure fluctuations
- Can damage separators and compressors
- Require proper **slug catchers** and **inlet control logic**

Flow Assurance Modeling Tools
------------------------------

Simulation is essential for predicting risks and designing mitigation strategies. Common tools include:

- **OLGA** – Dynamic multiphase flow simulator
- **PIPESIM** – Steady-state and nodal analysis
- **LedaFlow**, **Symmetry**, **Petrel RE**

Modeling objectives:

- Steady-state flow profile
- Transient events (shut-in/start-up)
- Slug tracking
- Chemical injection effectiveness
- Pressure/temperature envelope

Start-Up and Shut-Down Scenarios
---------------------------------

Critical phases where flow assurance risks are highest:

- **Start-up**: hydrate risk if fluids cooled during shutdown
- **Shut-down**: pressure equalization and condensate formation
- **Pigging operations**: solid displacement and restart control


.. note::

   Flow assurance is not just about chemistry—it combines fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, simulation, and operational strategy to keep subsea pipelines flowing.
