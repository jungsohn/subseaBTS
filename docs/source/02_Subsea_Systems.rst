Offshore Structures & Subsea Systems
=====================================

This section introduces the architecture, components, and functions of subsea systems that support offshore oil and gas production. These systems are essential for transporting hydrocarbons from the seabed to the surface, ensuring safety, reliability, and efficiency in harsh subsea environments.

Subsea Production System Overview
----------------------------------

Subsea production systems are installed on the seabed to extract oil and gas directly from subsea wells. These systems are typically tied back to floating production platforms or onshore facilities via flowlines and umbilicals.



Key Components
---------------

### 1. Subsea Tree (Xmas Tree)

A **subsea tree** is a critical assembly installed on the wellhead that controls the flow of hydrocarbons. It consists of valves, sensors, and chokes and is responsible for:

- Flow control (start/stop/regulate)
- Monitoring pressure and temperature
- Providing interfaces for intervention

There are two main types:
- **Conventional Vertical Tree (CVT)** – valves stacked vertically
- **Horizontal Tree (HT)** – valves located on the horizontal plane for easier access and intervention

### 2. Manifold

Manifolds serve as the junction point for multiple wells, routing production to a central flowline. They enable:

- Flowline consolidation
- Flow balancing and distribution
- Simplification of tiebacks

### 3. Flowlines and Jumpers

- **Flowlines**: Connect the manifold to risers or export pipelines.
- **Jumpers**: Short flexible or rigid segments that connect trees, manifolds, and flowlines.

### 4. Umbilicals

Umbilicals provide **power, control signals, chemicals, and hydraulics** to subsea equipment. They are composed of:

- Electrical cables (signal & power)
- Hydraulic tubes
- Fiber optics
- Chemical injection lines

### 5. Subsea Control Module (SCM)

SCMs are mounted on the tree or manifold and control valves and sensors. Functions include:

- Communication with topside control system
- Real-time data collection
- Safety valve actuation

Field Architecture
-------------------

The layout of a subsea production system depends on reservoir complexity, distance to host facility, and production strategy.

Common configurations:

- **Template-based systems**: Central structure housing multiple wells
- **Clustered architecture**: Groups of trees connected to a manifold
- **Daisy chain**: Sequential connection of multiple trees


System Integration & Interfaces
-------------------------------

A subsea system must be carefully integrated with surface facilities (topside) and pipelines. Key interface considerations include:

- **Mechanical interface**: Connectors and hubs for quick deployment and retrieval
- **Electrical interface**: Redundant power and signal paths for reliability
- **Hydraulic interface**: Multi-line umbilicals with high-pressure capability

Design Challenges
------------------

- Harsh environment (pressure, temperature, corrosion)
- Long step-outs and deepwater tiebacks
- Intervention and maintenance difficulty
- Flow assurance integration (hydrate/wax/slugs)

.. note::

   Subsea systems must be designed with reliability and redundancy in mind, following industry standards such as API 17 series and ISO 13628.
